# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

# WIP, Using alpha-level framework release

> ### [Ruby on Rails] with [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that implements a fullstack server-side varient of the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the community styleguides & best practices, especially with [Hotwire for Rails](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-rails) introduced for Rails 7.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
